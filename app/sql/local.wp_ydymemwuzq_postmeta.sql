He graduated from William Carey College (B.A.) and New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary (M.Div., Ph.D.) The Lord called him to ministry in 1972, and he has served Him as a theological educator and a Baptist college administrator since 1993. However, he has been involved in pastoral ministry since 1977. His greatest treasures are Connie, his little bride for 43 years, and their three grown sons, three remarkable daughters-in-law, and four fairly perfect grandchildren."),
